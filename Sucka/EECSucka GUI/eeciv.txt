"eeciv.zip" is freeware by Mike Kearny for viewing EECIV bins.
 
     I have enclosed a zip file for installing the EECSucka GUI I wrote.  
     You can read scalars, functions, and tables, if you know the address, 
     size, scaling factor(s), and data type of the data.  You can't view 
     the entire file at one time due to limitations with VB string size, I 
     will change this in a future version.  Once you download and install 
     the program once, you just need to install the .exe file (200kB) for 
     each new revision I come out with.  The program isn't finished 
     product, but its meant to be a free tool to anyone who needs it.  
     
     I would appreciate anyone using this, emailing me so I know how it 
     works and how many people are using it.  I would also like to know how 
     to make the file better.  I am thinking on focusing on cracking the 
     bin files by writing different search alogrithims, but I need to get 
     more data on bin files.
